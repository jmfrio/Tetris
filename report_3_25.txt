Time log:
30 minutes - SDL tutorial, attempted to open a blank window
90 minutes - writing Board class functions
30 minutes - writing driver program/testing Board class
30 minutes - committing files to github
45 minutes - group meeting to discuss progress and adjust goals
60 minutes - revising Board class based on group discussion
90 minutes - group meeting to make sure individual parts were consistent and
discuss next steps


How the Board.h class works:

The Board.h class is a 2D vector (default size 10x20) of ints.  The pieces classes will contain 8 data members that store the current coordinates of the piece.  The Board is initialized to 0s, and pieces will be represented by 1s.  The Board has the following functions:

display the current board
setRow, which allows the user to manually fill a row (mainly used for testing)
isRowFull, which returns a boolean value corresponding to whether or not a certain row is full
isSpotFull, which returns a boolean value corresponding to whether or not a
certain spot is full
removeRow, which is hard-coded to delete a certain row, move every other row down, and initialize the top row to 0s
among several other functions which have not yet been tested. 

We hope to have the pieces on the board soon and be able to move them around.
We plan on meeting with Professor Scott to help us in the process of putting
the pieces and the Board together.  

We decided that it would be more consistent for all of the piece classes to be
programmed by Jessie and Brittany, and for me to work more on the Board class.
However, splitting up the coding parts has not kept me from understanding the
structure and implementation of the piece classes.
