# Tetris

Before compiling the program, edit the ~/.cshrc file to let your programs know where the SDL library has been downloaded.

setenv PATH /afs/nd.edu/user14/csesoft/new/bin:$PATH
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /afs/nd.edu/user14/csesoft/new/lib

In the command line:
source ~/.cshrc

Then, compile the program normally using make. The executable generated by the Makefile is called "tetris".

To play the game:

Use the left and right arrows to move the piece on the board.
Use the down arrow to move the piece all the way down.
Use the up arrow to rotate the piece.
Use the space bar to pause the game for 5 seconds.
When a row is filled, it is deleted.
Press esc to exit the game before it is over.

The game ends when there is a piece in the top row.
