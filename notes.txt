need a function to set board to piece shape (how???)
	individual to each piece, so it should be in each derived class
	maybe hard-code board[x1][y1]=1 ... board[x4][y4]=1 (because all pieces have 4 squares)
update board by changing piece x1-x4, y1-y4 corodinates

set temp board = everything BUT newPiece.  Every time newPiece is turned,
revert to temp board and then update board by adding the piece with its
updated coordinates
